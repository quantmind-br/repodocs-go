## Notes

- Implementation plan created with 7 phases and 21 subtasks
- Total estimated effort: 12 weeks
- Phases prioritized by business criticality
- Hybrid testing strategy: unit tests with mocks + selected integration tests
- Adjusted thresholds for complex packages (renderer 40-50%, fetcher 70%, cache 75%)

## Next Steps

1. Start Phase 1, Subtask 1.1: Expand internal/strategies coverage
2. Run tests incrementally after each subtask
3. Generate coverage reports to verify thresholds
4. Update this file with progress

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Run unit tests (fast, with -short flag)
make test

# Run integration tests (network-dependent)
make test-integration

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Check coverage per package
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/strategies/...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep internal/strategies
```
